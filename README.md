# DEX
The Matrix [DEX](https://alinoorul.github.io/) is a set of decks. Updated each month starting 2023 AD.

It contains short descriptions of things in The Matrix. Ideas, companies, plans, projects, people, science: information. A wikipedia-like dex where pages are hyperlinked is being built. The dex is source code for movies, paintings, music, websites, apps, devices, robots, and technology. Bots and I use this for inspiration on what to build. It is regurgitate of my thoughts, frozen in time.

Feel free to use it how you see fit. It falls under CC0 so you don't even need to reference it. If you're working on something cool and think I can help, shoot me an email at manonthemoon13131@gmail.com.
