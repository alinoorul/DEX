# DEX
The Matrix [DEX](https://alinoorul.github.io/) is a set of decks. Updated each month starting 2023 AD.

It contains short descriptions of things in The Matrix. Ideas, companies, plans, projects, people, science: information. A wikipedia-like dex where pages are hyperlinked is being built by a bot and I. The dex is source code for movies, paintings, music, websites, apps, devices, robots, and technology. Bots and I use this for inspiration on what to build. It is regurgitate of my thoughts, frozen in time.

Feel free to use it how you see fit. It falls under CC0 so you don't even need to reference it. If you're working on something cool and think I can help, shoot me an email at manonthemoon13131@gmail.com.

Content in the Wikipedia-like dex is original and mine (with lots of inspiration), but the process of converting that content into beautified Wikipedia webpages in a website is done by a Python program dev.py. It inputs my PPTX, Word, and PDF files to create HTML pages, hyperlink them, and host them on Github like a Wikipedia. The work is locally on my machine, so I offer a monthly dynamism to static Github pages. Dev.py is a simple program I built because I have no money to hire web developers. But more importantly, Dev comes without some human limitations. It maintains my Dex with far more efficiency than a human being, though it has 0 learning ability.
